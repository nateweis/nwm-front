# New World Messages
A first attempt at making a instant messenger app
## How to use it
It functions much the same way as any instant messenger application
* You Sign in to your account
* Once logged in you can search for other members to add to your contacts
* You then create a chat room - this will add you to the chat room as the groups administrator
* Navigate into the chat room. Once inside you can add your friends as members of the chat room as well
* Anyone has the ability to leave the chat at anytime put only the admin can close the chat room or edit it alltogether
* anyone can edit their own messages whenever they want

### About the Project
This project was created on node/express backend with a react frontend. It uses postgreSQL for its database and it implements web sockets through socket.io for the instant message feature.
